üîä Sounds
==========

*JJ van Zon, 2023*

Samples used in 1990's amateur computer music projects.

They were ripped from really old __games__, from __CDs__, from other amateur __music projects__, __wave table__ synths, __recorded__, or __software generated__ with my own experimental programs.

I am organizing the sounds into folders as we speak. Without reorganization its usability it is hard to find the right samples for my music projects.
