üîä Sounds
==========

*JJ van Zon, 2023*

Samples used in 1990's amateur computer music projects.

Ripped from really old __games__, from __CDs__, other amateur __music projects__, __wave table__ synths, __recorded__ myself, or __generated__ with my own experimental software programs.

I am organizing the sounds into folders as we speak. Without reorganization it is hard to find the right samples for my music projects.

Most samples were 'ripped', but I am claiming it's 'fair use'.
Quality is rather low, and it should have no consequences for the original authors.
